# Unofficial AFL Fantasy Wrapped

## About

This is a personal project I made to give me some fun insights about the fantasy season.

It's a bit of a mess in terms of consistent naming and design with templates as I was learning a lot as I went through.
Not everything is tested as I was running close to the end of the season and wanted to make sure it was ready.

In the end it's a bit hacky in a few places but it was a lot of fun.
